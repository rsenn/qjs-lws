/**
 * Adapts qjs-modules' interactive `REPL` (built-in module 'repl' -
 * /usr/local/lib/quickjs/repl.js, a full-featured readline: history
 * (up/down arrow, ^R reverse-search), line editing (^A/^E/^K/word-motion/
 * kill-ring), persisted-across-sessions history file) to a chat loop
 * instead of a JS eval loop.
 *
 * `REPL#handleCmd()` is the method that runs once a line is submitted -
 * normally it colorizes/evals the line as JS (see repl.js). The stock
 * extension point for a non-JS handler, `run(inputHandler)` (which sets
 * `this.handleInput`), doesn't actually work in this build: `handleCmd()`
 * only consults `this.handleInput` when `hasBignum` is false, but this
 * build has BigFloat, so every submitted line silently takes the
 * BigFloatEnv/evalAndPrintStart path instead, no matter what
 * `run()` was given. Overriding `handleCmd()` directly sidesteps that
 * entirely - confirmed working (including a fix below for a related
 * batching bug) against a real interactive run.
